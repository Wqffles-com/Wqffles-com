## Hey! I'm Wqffles
I'm a solo developer working on Discord bots, my own TCP-based protocol and more!
I mainly use C#, although I've used more languages in the past, like TS, Java and Python.
I'm currently working at [Voltix](https://github.com/VoltixDev) as a developer and community manager.
I do not take commissions for Discord bots personally, if you'd like a bot please go to [Voltix](https://github.com/VoltixDev)
However, I do take commisions for any other coding projects, get in touch via my Discord for that!
